We are pleased, with my coauthors Antonin Bergeaud (London School of Economics) and Yoann Potiron (Keio University), to submit an original research article entitled ``Classifying Patents Based on their Semantic Content'' for consideration for publication in PLoS ONE. This article introduce a novel insight into the study of technological innovation, by describing a new methodology to classify patents according to their endogenous semantic content and by deploying it on a large scale database of US Patents. It does not rely on previously published work, but a preliminary version of the methodology and results were presented as a main track talk at Conference of Complex Systems 2016, Amsterdam, under the title ``Investigating Patterns Patterns of Technological Innovation''. We did not have any previous interaction with PLOS regarding this manuscript.
This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. We
have no conflicts of interest to disclose. We do not have any opposed reviewer. The authors believe that the following editors may be the most appropriate to handle this manuscript : César A Hidalgo (MIT), Tobias Preis (University of Warwick), Wolfgang Glanzel (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven).
Thank you for your consideration.
