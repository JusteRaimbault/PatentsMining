[{"abstract": "The present invention relates to cosmetic compositions which when administered orally or topically --a human being having hair, skin or scalp characterized by a greasy and unaesthetic appearance significantly improves the condition and appearance of the hair, scalp and skin by essentially eliminating this greasy and unaesthetic appearance. This condition of a greasy and unaesthetic appearance of the hair, skin and scalp can be occasioned by excessive secretions of the sebaceous glands and the compositions of this invention are useful in diminishing such excessive secretions. The compositions are also useful to combat dandruff. It has already been proposed for use in combatting against the greasy appearance of the hair as well as against the unaesthetic appearance of the skin certain S-substituted derivatives of cysteine and cysteamine. However, after further investigation, it has now been found that by using as the active component a hydroxylated amino thioether, an activity greater than that of previously known compounds for combatting against a greasy and unaesthetic appearance of the hair and skin is achieved. MOreover, it has been established that these hydroxylated amino thioethers exhibit excellent solubility in water and hydro-alcoholic solutions, a characteristic which permits the realization of many different types of cosmetic formulations. This solubility feature is due in particular to the presence of a hydroxyl group in the molecule of these active compounds. Consequently, relative to the previously known compounds, the active compounds of the present invention, exhibit increased activity and better solubility in water, alcohol and hydroalcoholic solutions. The present invention has for an object a new composition for combatting against the greasy and unaesthetic appearance of the hair and to improve the appearance of the skin, characterized by the fact that it contains in combination in an appropriate carrier, at least one active compound of the formula ##EQU6## wherein: R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 each independently, are selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, cyclohexyl, benzyl and B-hydroxyethyl, or R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 taken together form a divalent radical selected from the group consisting of --(CH.sub.2).sub.2 --(CH.sub.2).sub.2 --,--(CH.sub.2).sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --(CH.sub.2).sub.2 --, --(CH.sub.2).sub.2 --O--(CH.sub.2).sub.2 --, ##EQU7## an R is selected from the group consisting of: i. linear or branched alkyl having 1-18 carbon atoms, ii. alkenyl having 3-18 carbon atoms, iii. alkyl having 2-3 carbon atoms and substituted by 1-2 alcohol functions, i.e., OH groups, iv. --(CH.sub.2).sub.m --CH(OR.sub.3).sub.2 wherein R.sub.3 is alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms and m is 1-2, v. --(CH.sub.2).sub.n R.sub.4 wherein n is 0, 1 or 2 and R.sub.4 is selected from the group consisting of 2-pyridyl and phenyl, vi. --(CH.sub.2).sub.q R'.sub.4 wherein q is 0 or 1 and R'.sub.4 is selected from the group consisting of 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl and ##SPC3## xi. --CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --NH--Y wherein Y is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, nicotinyl and COR.sub.9 wherein R.sub.9 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl having 1-18 carbon atoms, alkenyl having 2-18 carbon atoms and ##SPC4## xiii. --(CH.sub.2).sub.s --COOH wherein s is 1-10.

The new compositions of the present invention can be provided in a variety of forms and they contain from 0.5 to 20, and preferably from 1 to 10 percent by weight of at least one active compound of formula I as defined above. Thus, the compositions can be aqueous or hydroalcoholic solutions or suspensions and comprise lotions for the care of the scalp. The low molecular weight alcohols which are generally used to produce the hydroalcoholic solutions or suspensions are ethanol and isopropanol. The compositions of the present invention can contain the above defined active compounds either singly, or as mixtures thereof, or even in admixture with other compounds previously known for use in combatting against a greasy and unaesthetic appearance of hair, or even in admixture with bactericide or fungicides. The compositions of the present invention can also contain such components as penetrating agents or perfumes which are generally employed in cosmetic preparations. The present invention also has for an object a process for treating hair in order to improve its appearance, said process being essentially characterized by the fact that the composition defined above is applied with massaging onto the scalp or hair. The quantity applied is generally between 10-20 cc of said composition. The new cosmetic compositions of the present invention can also take the form of a hair setting lacquer or lotion containing at least one active compound as defined in formula I in an appropriate cosmetic vehicle, or carrier with at least one conventional cosmetic film forming resin, generally having a molecular weight ranging from about 10,000 - 70,000. Representative cosmetic resins that can be employed include polyvinylpyrrolidone having a molecular weight ranging from 10,000 - 70,000; copolymer of vinylpyrrolidone and vinyl acetate (70%;30% to 30%: 70%-K ethanol 1% 25-50); copolymer of vinyl acetate and an unsaturated carboxylic acid such as crotonic acid (90%/10% molecular weight - 20,000); copolymer resulting from the polymerization of vinyl acetate (75-85%), crotonic acid (5-15%) and an acrylic or methacrylic ester or an alkyl vinyl either (5-15%); copolymer resulting from the copolymerization of vinyl acetate (63-88%), crotonic acid (5-15%) and a vinyl ester of long carbon chain acid having 10-22 carbon atoms or even an allyl or methallyl ester of a long carbon chain acid having 10-22 carbon atoms (5-25%); copolymer resulting from the copolymerization of an ester of an unsaturated alcohol having 2-12 carbon atoms and a saturated short carbon chain carboxylic acid having 2-5 carbon atoms (65- 80%) and unsaturated short carbon chain acid having 4-20 carbon atoms (7-12%) and at least one ester of a saturated long carbon chain alcohol having 8-18 carbon atoms and an unsaturated short carbon chain having 4-20 arbon atoms (10-20%); and a copolymer resulting from the polymerization of at least one unsaturated ester and at least one unsaturated acid. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the cosmetic resins contained in the compositions can have lateral side chains at the extremity of which can be found a thiol function. The cosmetic resins contained in these compositions in the form of a hair setting lotion or lacquer can also be constituted by colored polymers, that is, polymers containing in the macromolecular chains dye molecules which impart to the hair a particular coloration or shade. These compositions can also contain direct dyes to effect coloring or tinting of the hair. The compositions can also contain components conventionally employed in cosmetic preparations for setting the hair such as penetrating agents, surfactants, dyes, perfumes and the like. The cosmetic vehicle or carrier used to produce this type of composition can be constituted by mixtures conventionally used to produce hair setting lacquers or lotions. Thus, these cosmetic compositions can comprise an alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solution of at least one active commpound of formula I and of a resin to provide a hair setting lotion. A hair setting lotion can be, for example, provided by introducing into a hydroalcoholic solution having a content of 0-70% alcohol, 1-20% and preferably 1-3% relative to the solution of a resin as defined above. The alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solution of the active compound can also be mixed with a conventional quantity of liquified propellant gas under pressure and packaged in an aerosol container and constitute that which is conventionally considered a lacquer for the hair. For example, an aerosol lacquer for the hair can be provided by introducing 1-20%, preferably 1-5%, of a resin as defined above in a mixture comprising one-fourth to one-third by weight of a lower alkanol and two-thirds to three-fourths by weight of a liquified propellant gas under pressure. Conventional aerosol propellants such as fluoronated hydrocarbons including the freons can be employed. Representative of such propellants are dichlorodifluoromethane, trichloromonofluoromethane and mixtures thereof. Obviously, other well known propellants can also be used. In these hair setting lotions or lacquers, the concentration of the active compound is generally from 0.5 to 20 weight percent, thereby making it possible to treat the hair by subjecting it to a hair setting operation, this process being essentially characterized by the fact that the hair is impregnated with said composition containing in combination the active compound of formula I with a conventional cosmetic resin, rolling the hair up on hair setting rollers and drying the hair. The cosmetic compositions of this invention can also take the form of a topically applied shampoo which also effectively combats against a greasy and unaesthetic appearance of the hair. These shampoo compositions are essentially characterized by the fact that they contain, in combination, at least one anionic, cationic, nonionic or amphoteric detergent with at least one active compound of formula I as defined above. Representative anionic detergents include alkyl sulfates, alkylether sulfates, alkylpolyether sulfates, alkyl sulfonates (the alkyl moiety having 8-18 carbon atoms), monoglyceride sulfates, alkanolamide sulfates, alkanolamide sulfones, soaps of fatty acids, monosulfosuccinates of fatty alcohols, the condensation product of a fatty acid with isethionic acid, the condensation product of fatty acids with methyl taurine, the condensation product of fatty acids with sarcosine and the condensation product of fatty acids with a protein hydrolyzate. Representative cationic detergents include long chain quaternary ammoniums, esters of fatty acids and amino alcohols and polyether amines. Specifically, there can be used dilauryldimethyl ammonium chloride, diisobutyl phenoxyethoxy ethyl dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, N-cetyl pyridinium bromide and benzethonium chloride, lauryl benzyl trimethyl ammonium bromide or chloride, myristyl benzyl trimethyl ammonium bromide or chloride and cetyl benzyl trimethyl ammonium bromide or chloride. Representative nonionic detergents are the esters of polyols and sugars, the condensation product of ethylene oxide on fatty acids, on fatty alcohols, on long chain alkylphenols, on long chain mercaptans, on long chain amides, and polyethers of polyhydroxylated fatty alcohols. Suitable amphoteric detergents include asparagine derivatives, the condensation product of monochloroacetic acid or imidazolines and alkylamino propionates. The shampoo compositions of the present invention contain from 0.1-20%, preferably from 0.5-10% by weight of the active compound of formula I defined above. They also contain, for example, from 4 to 15%, preferably from 5 to 7% by weight of detergent in an aqueous medium and can have a pH of about 3-8. The shampoos as defined above can also contain other conventional cosmetic components such as perfumes, dyes, or again, bactericides or fungicides especially when the shampoos also have an anti-dandruff activity. They can also contain thickeners such as alkanolamides of fatty acids, cellulose derivatives (for example, carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxymethyl cellulose), esters of long chain polyols and natural gums, so as to provide a cream or gel. These shampoo compositions can also be provided in the form of a powder which can be applied either to wet hair, or which can be dissolved in a predetermined volume of water before washing the hair. These shampoo compositions can also include conventional dyes to tint or color the hair. The shampoo compositions make it possible to combat against a greasy and unaesthetic appearance of the hair, as well as against dandruff by applying the same to the hair, which optionally can be previously wetted, in amounts effective to impregnate the hair, massaging the scalp for a time in the order of a few minutes and rinsing the hair. Usually, satisfactory results are obtained by shampooing once a week. This regimen provides a significant reduction and in certain cases, substantially complete elimination of the greasy appearance of the hair, while also providing normal care for the hair. The cosmetic compositions of this invention can also take the form of a topically applicable composition to effect a permanent waving of the hair exhibiting a greasy or unaesthetic appearance caused by a dandruff condition or an excessive secretion of sebum by the sebaceous glands. As is known, the permanent deformation of the hair can be achieved in one stage or two stages. When the permanent deformation of the hair is achieved in two stages, the active compound of formula I above can be present either in the reducing composition employed to effect the first stage, or in the oxidation or neutralization composition employed to effect the second stage of the permanent waving operation. When the permanent deformation of the hair is achieved in a single stage, a self-neutralizing composition contains, in combination with the self-neutralizing agent, the active compound of formula I above. In accordance with the invention, the composition for effecting the first stage of a two-stage operation contains at least one compound for reducing the disulfide linkages of keratin, such as thioglycolic acid, ammonium thioglycolate, thioglycerol or thiolactic acid, in combination with at least one active compound of formula I above, present in amounts of 0.1 - 20 weight percent, the pH of the composition being preferably between 3 and 9.5. The second stage of the operation is then carried out using a conventional oxidizing or neutralizing composition, not containing the active compound of formula I above. In another embodiment of the present invention the first stage of the permanent wave operation can be carried out using a conventional reducing agent, followed by carrying out the second stage using a neutralizing or oxidizing agent composition containing the active compound of formula I present in an amount between 0.5 - 20% by weight of the composition and preferably between 1 and 10 weight percent thereof. When the permanent deformation of the hair is achieved in a single stage, the self-neutralizing composition contains, in combination, a thiol and an organic disulfide in a molar ratio of disulfide to thiol greater than 1, with the active compound of formula I, being present in an amount between 0.1 and 20%, and preferably between 0.5 and 10%, by weight of said composition. The present invention has also for an object the provision of a composition to effect the permanent deformation of hair such as described above, which composition is packaged in two parts. According to this embodiment of the invention, one part can be constituted by a conventional reducing composition, while the other part can contain the active compound of formula I or, alternatively, one part is constituted by a conventional neutralizing composition while the other part is constituted by the active compound of formula I. The composition of this invention employed to effect a permanent deformation of the hair can also contain conventional components for similar cosmetic compositions such as penetrating agents, surface active agents, dyes and perfumes. The cosmetic vehicle or carrier useful for the production of these permanent waving compositions can be those generally employed for the production of permanent waving compositions such as water, lower alkanols and their mixtures as defined above. Further, these compositions can be provided in the form of a solution, foam, cream or gel. In a particular embodiment, the alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solution employed as the carrier in the permanent waving composition can also be used in combination with a conventional quantity of liquified propellant gas and packaged under pressure in an aerosol container to provide  pg,22 a sprayable aerosol formulation. These permanent waving compositions make it possible to perform a process for effecting the permanent waving of greasy hair, in two steps or in a single stage operation, this process being characterized by the fact that the reducing or neutralization composition, or the self-neutralization composition contains, in addition to the reducing or oxidizing agent, or conventional self-neutralizer, at least one active compound of formula I above. In yet another embodiment of the present invention a dermal lotion can be prepared which contains the active compound defined above in combination with an appropriate cosmetic vehicle for application to the skin to improve its appearance when it exhibits a greasy appearance. Such compositions can, preferably, be provided in the form of a cream, milk, gel, dermatological cake or aerosol foam. These compositions can also be provided as an aqueous or hydroalcoholic solution. Such dermal lotions generally contain between 0.5-20 weight percent of at least one active compound according to formula I above. These compositions can also contain any conventional component ususally employed in facial beauty creams, such as fatty bodies, emulsifiers, preservatives, perfumes, dyes and waxes. They can also contain colored pigments which permit to color the skin and mask skin defects. These compositions which can be applied to the skin also make it possible to perform a process for improving the appearance of the skin, this process being characterized by the fact that a composition as defined above is applied to those parts of the skin requiring treatment. These dermal compositions can also contain bactericides or fungicides. As has been stated before, the use of such agents is particularly recommended in compositions for use in combatting dandruff as well as in dermal lotions to improve the appearance of oily skin. Representative bactericides or fungicides useful in the present invention include hexachlorophene, quaternary ammonium compounds such as tetradecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide as well as compounds described in Luxembourg Patents Nos. 59,405; 60,384 and 65,350. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention there is provided a composition and method for eliminating or significantly reducing a greasy and unaesthetic appearance of the hair and scalp which comprises orally administering to a human being having hair and a scalp so characterized a therapeutic composition comprising an ingestible carrier admixed with, as a non-toxic active component, the active compound of formula I. In the case of greasy appearing hair which can, as stated above, be caused by an excessive secretion of sebum by the sebaceous glands, such treatment is particularly advantageous in that the greasy appearance can be eliminated without disturbing the coiffure. The oral composition of this invention generally contains the active compound in amounts between 0.1 and 50% and, preferably, between 1 and 20% by weight of said composition. The active compound can be dissolved in an alimentary liquid, such as water or an aqueous solution of a nontoxic lower alcohol, optionally aromatized. The active compound can also be incorporated into a solid ingestible excipient and be present, for example, in the form of granules, pills, tablets or lozenges. They can also be dissolved in an alimentary liquid which in turn is packaged in an ingestible capsule. The active compounds of the present invention are non-toxic and, therefore, the specific amounts orally administered can be left to the discretion of the user. However, it has been found appropriate to use the orally administered compositions for successive periods of 15 days with a 15 day interruption at a dosage of about 100 mg. per 24 hour period. These oral compositions make it possible to carry out a process for combatting against a greasy and unaesthetic appearance of the hair and skin, this process being characterized by the fact that a composition containing the active compound, in combination with an ingestible vehicle is orally administered to a person having hair and skin so characterized.

The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to three reaction schemes (a), (b) and (c) as follows: Reaction Scheme (a) ##EQU15## wherein X = Hal, --OSO.sub.2 CH.sub.3 or --OSO.sub.2 C.sub.6 H.sub.4 pCH.sub.3. Reaction Scheme (b) ##EQU16## wherein X has the meanings given above. Reaction Scheme (c) ##EQU17## wherein X has the meanings given above. As can be seen, reactions (a) and (b) are effected in both cases by beginning with a thio R-SH(I) which is reacted either on a halogenide or on a 3-amino-2-hydroxy propyl sulfonate (II), or on a 3-hydroxy azetidinium salt (IV). The halogenides or 3-amino-2-hydroxy propyl sulfonates are obtained by the addition of a secondary amine of the type R.sub.1 R.sub.2 NH on epichlorohydrin or on a glycidyl sulfonate. Because of the instability of these halogenides or 3-amino-2-hydroxy propyl sulfonates, which can rather easily be transformed into an azetidinium (IV), particularly under the action of heat and in the course of time, it is preferable not to isolate them but rather react them directly with the thiol, R-SH (I). On the other hand, the 3-hydroxy azetidinium salts (IV) are stable and can be isolated and optionally purified. These azetidinium salts can, for example, be prepared in accordance with German patent 1,111,638. Reaction scheme (C) reverses the reaction partners in the sense that the radical R is linked to the halogen or to the sulfonate function while the 3-amino-2-hydroxy propyl radical carries the thiol function. Compounds (IV) and (I) can be replaced by a precursor such as an isothiouronium salt of formula (VII) or (VIII), given below which is capable of liberating compound (VI) or (I) in the reaction medium by the action of a base of the same type as those which permit the reactions (c) and (a). Compound (VII): ##EQU18## Compound (VIII) ##EQU19## Generally, reaction schemes (a), (b) and (c) are effected under conventional conditions required for nucleophilic substitution; thus, the solvent can be water, alcohol, dioxane or dimethyl formamide, alone or in admixture. The base employed can be either an alkali or alkaline earth hydroxide or carbonate or an alkali or alkaline earth alcoholate or hydride, or it can be ammonia or even an aliphatic tertiary amine, such as triethylamine. Reactions (a), (b) and (c) are generally carried out at a temperature between 30.degree. and 100.degree.C, the reaction time often being about 30 minutes to 10 hours. To obtain the active compounds in salt form, the acid corresponding to the desired salt, is first dissolved in an appropriate solvent. Then there is introduced into this solution, the active compound either in the pure state or in the dissolved state, preferably in the same solvent which serves for the dissolution of the acid. The solvent selected, preferably is not a solvent for the desired salt. To prepare the hydrochlorides, it is generally more advantageous to dissolve the active compound in an appropriate solvent, after which gaseous HCl is bubbled therethrough. The hydrochloride of the desired compound generally precipitates under these conditions.
