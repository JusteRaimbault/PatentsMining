[{"title": "4-Aminoquinoline derivatives", "abstract": "The present invention concerns new 4-aminoquinoline derivatives, a process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The invention also concerns new intermediates useful for the preparation of the 4-aminoquinoline derivatives. The invention provides new 4-aminoquinoline derivatives of the general formula ##SPC2## The invention also provides a new class of compounds useful as intermediates for the preparation of compounds of formula I and their acid addition salts. These new compounds are benzenesulphonamides having the formula ##SPC4## and their acid addition salts, where R is as defined in connection with formula I, Z is as defined in connection with formula I or is a protected amino or hydroxyl group and Y is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkanoyl group. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the above definition of R includes moieties possessing an asymmetric carbon atom, especially for instance, in the cases where In the compounds of formula I, X preferably represents a halogen atom, for example, a chlorine or bromine atom, but may also represent a trifluoromethyl group. Illustrative meanings of Z in formulae I and IV include hydrogen, chlorine, bromine atoms and trifluoromethyl, lower alkyl or alkoxy (for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and butoxy), hydroxyl, nitro, amino, methylamino, ethylamino, dimethylamino and diethylamino groups. Additionally in formula IV, Z may be protected amino or protected hydroxyl group, for example a group of the formula IX ##SPC7## In formulae II and IIIb R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 may be separate or may be joined together to form a divalent residue. The divalent residue is a diacyl residue of a dicarboxylic acid, for example, a group of the formula --CO--(CH.sub.2).sub.n --CO-- where n is 2 or 3, or ##SPC8## R.sub.1, when in formula IIIa or when separate from R.sub.2 in formula II or IIIb, represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aralkyl group, an acyl group or an aryl group, R.sub.2, when separate from R.sub.1 in formulae II and IIIb, represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aralkyl group or an acyl group. R.sub.3 in formulae II and IIIa represents a hydrogen atom, a cycloalkyl group of 5 to 7 carbon atoms, an alkyl group, an aralkyl group, or an aliphatic chain joining the nitrogen ring atom to another ring atom of the ring shown in formula IIIa. Illustrative examples of such groups that can be denoted by R.sub.1, R.sub.2 or R.sub.3 will now be described. Alkyl groups are desirably lower alkyl groups, for example, methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl and n-butyl. Aryl groups particularly comprehend phenyl or phenyl substituted by one or more substituents. As substituents for a phenyl group there may be employed lower alkyl (for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl), lower alkoxy (for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or butoxy), nitro, halogen, (preferably chlorine or bromine), hydroxy, trifluoromethyl or amino (including mono- or dialkylamino, for instance, dimethylamino). Aralkyl groups are arylsubstituted alkyl groups, where the alkyl group is desirably a lower alkyl group (e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl) and its aryl substituent may be phenyl or substituted phenyl, in which the one or more substituents for phenyl are as mentioned above. Acyl groups particularly include the acyl groups of the formula -- CO.R.sub.5 where R.sub.5 represents alkyl or aryl. As specific acyl groups there may be mentioned, for example, acetyl, propionyl, butanoyl, hexanoyl, benzoyl and benzoyl substituted by one or more of the above mentioned substituents for phenyl. As cycloalkyl of 5 to 7 carbon atoms there may be mentioned cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. As alkyl substituted by a heterocyclyl group there may be mentioned lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl, substituted by thienyl (for instance 2-thienyl), furyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl (for instance 4-pyrazolyl), indolyl, pyridyl (for instance 2- or 4-pyridyl), quinolyl, thiazolyl (specifically 2-, 4- or 5-thiazolyl), isothiazolyl or oxazolyl. As examples of A in formula II there may be mentioned methylene, dimethylene, trimethyleme, tetramethylene and pentamethylene and their mono- or di-(lower alkyl) substitution products, for example, groups of the formulae ##EQU1## The piperidine of pyrrolidine ring shown in formulae IIIa and IIIb may be substituted with one or more alkyl groups, preferably lower alkyl groups, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl. As examples of R containing a piperidine or pyrrolidine ring there may be mentioned groups of the formula: ##SPC9## In formula IV the symbol Y denotes a hydrogen atom or a lower alkanoyl group, for example, acetyl, propionyl, butanoyl or hexanoyl. In formulae I and IV the -- SO.sub.3 R group is preferably at the para-position relative to the 7-substituted-4-quinolylamino group in formula I and the group Y--NH-- in the case of formula IV. Thus the preferred new compounds of the invention are those of the formulae Ia and IVa ##SPC10## The term \"lower\" as used herein in connection with such groups as \"alkanoyl\", \"alkyl\" or \"alkoxy\" denotes that the group contains up to 6 carbon atoms, preferably up to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of acid addition salts are those formed from inorganic and organic acids and in particular include sulphate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, phosphate, sulphonate (such as the methanesulphonate and p-toluene-sulphonate), acetate, maleate, fumarate, tartrate, malonate, citrate and formate. The compounds of the formula I may be made by building the compound up by known reactions. In particular the sulphonamide linkage shown in formula I may be formed by sulphonylation of an appropriate amine, and an amino-benzene sulphonamide may be converted to the secondary amine by introducing the 7-(halo or trifluoromethyl)-4-quinolyl group in known manner. The invention provides a method of making compounds of the formula I and their acid addition salts, wherein a compound of the formula RH, where R is as defined in connection with formula I, or, where necessary or desired, a corresponding compound with a protecting group, is sulphonylated to introduce the sulphonyl group of formula XIV ##SPC11## As sulphonating agent there may particularly be used a sulphonyl chloride of formula XV ##SPC12## Where necessary or if desired, the process may also include removal of a protecting group, and if desired, conversion of a free base form of compound of formula I into an acid addition salt or conversion of an acid addition salt form of a compound of formula I into the corresponding free base form. Starting materials of formula RH and formulae XV are known compounds or, if new, are accessible by conventional methods. The sulphonylation method may be carried out by reacting the compound of formula XV with the compound of formula RH or a corresponding compound with a protecting group in chloroform in the presence of a saturated sodium carbonate solution. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain unacylated compounds of formula RH may present more than one potentially reactive location for sulphonylation. Undesired sulphonylation may be avoided by chemical protection with removable blocking groups or other means. For example, the compounds of the formula ##SPC15## Compounds of formula I and their acid addition salts, in which, in formula IIIa, R.sub.3 denotes hydrogen, may be prepared by using, for example, a benzyl group as removable protecting group. Thus a starting compound of formula: ##SPC16## Compounds of the formula IV and their acid addition salts are accessible by a process wherein a compound formula RH where R is as defined in formula I, or a corresponding compound with a protecting group, is sulphonylated to introduce the sulphonyl group of formula: ##SPC18## The reaction of the primary amine XVI with the compound of formula XVII may be carried out at elevated temperature in the presence of a suitable acidic solvent for example phenol or dilute hydrochloric acid. The reaction products may be recovered from the reaction mixtures by standard isolation procedures. In certain cases it is expedient to incorporate a protecting group for amino in the compound of formula XVI to reduce or preclude undesired reaction of the compounds of formula XVII with a primary or secondary amino function in the group R. In such cases the protecting group is removed after the reaction with the compound of formula XVII. The compounds of formula I may be isolated in free base form or as an acid addition salt. Acid addition salts may be converted into the free base in conventional manner. The free base forms may be converted into acid addition salts in conventional manner, for instance, by adding ethereal hydrogen chloride to a solution of the free base where a hydrochloride salt is desired. The sulphonylating agents used for reaction with a compound of formula RH can be prepared in known manner from the corresponding sulphonic acid. The sulphonic acid may be prepared by reacting an aminobenzene -sulphonic acid of the formula: ##SPC22## Some of the compounds of formula I may also be prepared by another method using the amide of the general formula XXV ##SPC24## The compounds of formula I where R has formula II and R.sub.3 is an alkyl group, an aralkyl group or an alkyl group substituted by a heterocyclic group may be prepared by two successive alkylations of the amide of formula XXV, each carried out in aqueous or alcoholic alkaline solution. In this case the alkylation carried out to introduce the group R.sub.3 is preferably the second of the two reactions. Thus, for example, compounds of formula I where R is a group of formula II may be prepared by the reaction sequence ##SPC27## The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are indicated for pharmacological usage and, in some cases, for use as intermediates for the preparation of other compounds of formula I. For instance, the compounds of formula I demonstrate anti-hypertensive activity and, in some cases, also demonstrate at least one of the following activities: anti-malarial activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-trichomonal activity and inhibition of blood platelet aggregation. For example, in addition to their anti-hypertensive activity, 4-(7-chloro-4-quinolyamino)-N-(1-ethyl-3-piperidyl)benzenesulphonamide shows anti-inflammatory activity, anti-trichomonal activity and inhibition of blood platelet aggregation and 4-dimethylamino-1-[4-(7-chloro-4-quinolyamino)-benzenesulphonyl]-piperdine shows anti-malarial and anti-trichomonal activity. The compounds are evaluated for their activity by testing in standard procedures. Some of the compounds of the invention may also be used as intermediates for the preparation of other compounds conforming with formula I. For example, compounds containing a phthalimido group as --NR.sub.1 R.sub.2 in formula II or IIb may be subjected to cleavage using hydrazizne to form a corresponding compound containing an amino group (--NH.sub.2) as --NR.sub.1 R.sub. 2 and compounds containing an amino group may be alkylated to form a corresponding compound with an alkyl-substituted amino groups. The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions containing as active ingredients a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, which may be micronised if desired. In addition to the active ingredient, said compositions also contain a non-toxic carrier. Any suitable carrier known in the art can be used to prepare the pharmaceutical compositions. In such a composition, the carrier may be a solid, liquid or mixture of a solid and a liquid. Solid form compositions include powders, tablets and capsules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilisers, suspending agents, binders, or tablet-disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating material. In powders the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active ingredient. In tablets the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5 to 99, preferably 10-80% of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a low melting wax, and cocoa butter. The term \"composition\" is intended to include the formulation of an active ingredient with encapsulating material as carrier to give a capsule in which the active ingredient (with or without other carriers) is surrounded by carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly cachets are included. Sterile liquid form compositions include sterile solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs. The active ingredient can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable sterile liquid carrier, such as sterile water, sterile organic solvent or a mixture of both. Preferably a liquid carrier is one suitable for parenteral injection. Where the active ingredient is sufficiently soluble it can be dissolved in normal saline as a carrier; if it is too insoluble for this it can be dissolved in a suitable organic solvent, for instance aqueous propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol solutions. Aqueous propylene glycol containing from 10 to 75% of the glycol by weight is generally suitable. In other instances compositions can be made by dispersing the finely-divided active ingredient in aqueous starch or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution, or in a suitable oil, for instance arachis oil. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions which are sterile or suspensions can be utilised by intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection. In many instances a compound is orally active and can be administered orally either in liquid or solid composition form. Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage form. In such form, the composition is sub-divided in unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active ingredient; the unit dosage form can be a packaged composition, the package containing specific quantities of compositions, for example packeted powders or vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can be a capsule, cachet or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in package form. The quantity of active ingredient in a unit dose of composition may be varied or adjusted from 5 mg. or less to 500 or more, according to the particular need and the activity of the active ingredient. The invention also includes the compounds in the absence of carrier where the compounds are in unit dosage form. The disclosure describes new 4-aminoquinoline derivatives of general formula ##SPC1## And their acid addition salts, where X is a halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl group, Z is a hydrogen atom or a defined substituent, R is group of the formula Or where A in formula II is a chain of 1 to 5 methylene groups which may be substituted with alkyl, the ring in formula IIIa and IIIb is a piperidine or pyrrolidine ring that may be substituted with alkyl and R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and R.sub.3 represent hydrogen or certain defined substituents. The new 4-aminoquinoline derivatives show anti-hypertensive activity and, in some cases, show one or more of the following activities: anti-malarial activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-trichomonal activity and inhibition of blood platelet aggregation. And their acid addition salts, where Wherein: for example, in the cases where R denotes groups of the formula ##SPC6## where R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and R.sub.3 may be, for instance, hydrogen or lower alkyl. It is to be understood that general formulae I and IV are intended to encompass both enantiomers where the compound contains an asymmetric carbon atom and mixtures of the enantiomers, for instance, a racemic mixture of the enantiomers. General methods are recorded in the literature for the resolution of enantiomers. or is such that R.sub.1 R.sub.2 NH is a secondary cyclic amine with 5 to 7 ring atoms, for instance, piperidine, pyrrolidine or morpholine. where m is 0 or 1; R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and R.sub.3 are as defined above; and R.sub.6, R.sub.7, R.sub.8 and R.sub.9, which may be the same or different may be hydrogen or lower alkyl, for instance, methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl. where X is defined in connection with formula I and Z is as defined in connection with formula IV. where X is as defined above and Z is as defined in connection with formula IV.

Q is for example, an iodine atom, a bromine atom or a chloride atom or an organosulphonate group, for instance, p-toluenesulphonate. (wherein n is 0 or 1) may be sulphonylated at the ring nitrogen atom by using a starting material in which the NH.sub.2 function is protected with a blocking group which is removed after acylation. in which R.sub.3 is benzyl is sulphonylated and the protecting group is removed after sulphonylation by debenzylation. Debenzylation may be carried out using sodium in liquid ammonia or by catalytic hydrogenation under conditions such that the 7-halo- or 7-trifluoromethyl substituents on the quinolyl group is not removed. In addition, compounds of formula RH include compounds where a substituent on an aryl group or heterocyclyl group is susceptible to sulphonylation, e.g. a free hydroxyl or amino substituent. Such substituents may be protected with a removable blocking group which is cleaved off after sulphonylation. Sulphonylating derivatives for introducing the group of formula XIV include protection for a group Z sensitive to sulphonylation. For example, a final product in which Z is an amino function can be formed by using a sulphonylating derivative of the acid formula XX. ##SPC17## and, after sulphonylation, converting the phthalimido group to an NH.sub.2 group by reaction with hydrazine. The new compounds of the invention are comparatively stable to hydrolysis and therefore favour protecting groups that are readily hydrolysed off under acid or basic conditions. where Y' is a lower alkanoyl group and Z is as defined above in connection with formula IV. The sulphonylating agent used is preferably the sulphonyl chloride of formula: ##SPC19## where Y' and Z are as defined in formula XXI. The corresponding sulphonylation product has the formula: ##SPC20## This product may be isolated as such or as an acid addition salt. This product may then be converted to the compound of formula XVI ##SPC21## by hydrolysis, preferably under alkaline conditions, to remove the lower alkanoyl group Y'. The compound of formula XVI may be recovered as the free base or as an acid addition salt. where Z is as defined in connection with formula IV with a compound of formula XVII ##SPC23## where X is a halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl group and Q is a group or atom replaceable by nucleophilic attack by the compound of formula XXIV.

It may be purified salt formation and liberating the acid from the salt. The sulphonic acid or its salt may be converted into sulphonylating derivatives of the acid in known manner. For example the sulphonyl chloride of formula XV may be formed by reacting the corresponding sulphonic acid with thionyl chloride in the presence of dimethylformamide as catalyst. where X is as defined above and Z is as defined in respect of formula IV. The amide can be prepared by reaction of the sulphonyl chloride of formula XV with ammonium hydroxide solution and isolated from the reaction mixture. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound having general formula I wherein R is a group of formula II or IIIa and their acid addition salts. The compounds wherein R is a group of formula II and R.sub.3 is a hydrogen atom and wherein R is a group of formula IIIa whilst R.sub.1 is a hydrogen atom can be obtained by alkylation of the amide of formula XXV in aqueous or alcoholic alkaline solution. By means of this alkylation the group --A--NR.sub.1 R.sub.2 or the group ##SPC25## is introduced. The alkylating agent used is preferably the halide of formula: where Hal stands for a halogen atom preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine. Alternatively the corresponding sulphonates or organosulphonates may be used as alkylating agents. where Qu is the 7-(halo or trifluoromethyl)-4-quinolyl residue. Similarly the compounds of formula I where R is a group of formula IIIa and R.sub.1 is an alkyl or aralkyl group may be prepared by two successive alkylations of the amide of formula XXV in aqueous or alcoholic alkaline solution. One such alkylation introduces the group ##SPC28## whilst the other introduces the group R.sub.1. The reaction medium used for the alkylation of the amide of formula XXV may be an aqueous solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide. Alternatively the alkaline solution may be prepared from a lower alkanol, for example ethanol. The products of the alkylation steps may be recovered as such or as the acid addition salts in accordance with conventional isolation procedures. I.

More particularly, it is directed to filled polystyrene compositions. For many years, the cost of polystyrene and impact polystyrene was not much higher than the cost of fillers conventionally used in the rubber industry. From the rubber industry, it has been well known that the cost of incorporating fillers into rubber is significant but is a necessary feature to achieve the required strength properties in the rubber compounds. Such incorporation of fillers into rubber requires the use of high shear mixing equipment. Plastics generally do not require the presence of filler to achieve good strength properties. All of the above have combined in the past such that the thermoplastics industry has used very few fillers and then usually only in small amounts for limited very special applications. Consequently, the plastics industry, particularly the thermoplastic rather than the thermoset segment, has not had the need for high shear mixing equipment. Examples of special applications where fillers have been incorporated into plastics include the fibre reinforced field and certain types of compounds such as polyvinyl chloride. Polystyrene compositions containing glass fibres are finding their place as commercial products. Similarly, some applications are being developed for polystyrene compositions containing asbestos fibres. Polyvinyl chloride compositions containing very high levels of fillers, normally white fillers, are frequently used for the exterior finish of buildings. In the thermoplastics industry, as distinct from the thermoset industry, blending of thermoplastics with various additives usually utilizes relatively low shear mixing equipment. Thermoplastics, including polystyrene compositions, have been blended with pigments, fire retardants, antidegradants, anti-static agents and colouring agents. Many of these blends are achieved by dry mixing of powdered additive with the thermoplastic in pelletized form followed by limited further mixing, as in an extruder. These additives present in the thermoplastic do not contribute to the mechanical strength properties of the plastic. Certain materials, as for example zinc oxide, may be used during the preparation of polystyrene compositions, such as when impact polystyrene is prepared by the suspension process, zinc oxide is sometimes added as a suspending agent prior to the initiation of the polymerization -- however, it is conventional practice to wash out the majority of the zinc oxide, or other similar inorganic compounds, after the completion of the polymerization. Thereby it has not been common practice to prepare polystyrene compositions containing, for example, zinc oxide present in the composition as a filler. It is an objective of this invention to provide a method to alleviate the shortage of a thermoplastic by a process for the production of a mouldable thermoplastic composition having filler incorporated therein. It is a further objective of this invention to provide a process for the production of a filled mouldable thermoplastic composition by a low energy consuming method. It is a still further objective of this invention to provide a low cost mouldable thermoplastic composition having acceptable properties which composition contains fillers to replace part of the thermoplastic. It has now been found that a filled mouldable thermoplastic composition is produced by a process wherein a masterbatch containing an impact polystyrene, filler, rubber and oil is mixed with a polystyrene composition. This process overcomes the problems due to the lack of mixing equipment, as shown hereinafter, and provides a composition of reasonable price and acceptable properties which utilizes a lesser weight of polystyrene in the final product. Much attention has focused on the cost of energy and concurrent shortages of many chemical compounds, especially those derived from petroleum products. Styrene monomer is one material for which the supply situation may often be limited as a result of this shortage of chemical compounds. One way to extend the value of styrene polymers is that well known in the art of improving the impact strength of polystyrene by incorporating therein a small quantity of rubber. The rubber may be incorporated by mechanical mixing of the polystyrene and rubber particles or by dissolving the rubber in styrene monomer and polymerizing the styrene in the presence of the dissolved rubber. Such improved products are known as impact polystyrenes. Because of the higher strength properties of the impact polystyrene, it is frequently possible to use smaller quantities of the impact polystyrene to serve the same purpose which would otherwise be served by a crystal polystyrene. If a means can be found of producing a composition having the desirable general properties of polystyrene and yet only containing from about 50 to about 90 percent of its weight as polystyrene, the balance of the weight being a lower cost, less energy dependent material, such a composition would be of considerable commercial value and could make a significant contribution toward alleviating material shortages. The fillers conventionally used in rubbers generally have a high specific gravity when compared to the specific gravity of polystyrene. Their use in admixture with polystyrene thereby would yield a more dense material having no volume advantage. It is also well known in the art that the incorporation of mineral fillers directly into polystyrene generally causes a reduction in the strength characteristics of the mixture. The essential features of this invention lie in the discovery that a polystyrene product with acceptable properties can be prepared, which product contains quantities of filler, rubber and oil, in addition to at least one polystyrene. The exact reasons why such products unexpectedly possess such reasonable properties is not known. The addition of filler alone to styrene makes the polymer stiff and intractable. The addition of a rubber component to polystyrene plus filler appears to somewhat reduce the stiffening effect of the filler and leads to improvement of the impact properties. The addition of an oil appears to further reduce the stiffening effect caused by the presence of the filler and to improve the melt-flow characteristics which have been reduced by the presence of the filler and the rubber. The presence in the composition of the four components appears to be necessary to obtain the overall balance of desirable properties. Polystyrene preparation is well known in the art. Styrene monomer, optionally containing a small amount of a solvent such as ethyl benzene, may be bulk polymerized with the aid of a free radical polymerization initiator or by thermal initiation. Styrene monomer may also be polymerized in a suspension process using a free radical polymerization initiator. Rubber modified polystyrene, more commonly known as impact polystyrene, may be produced by polymerizing rubber dissolved in styrene monomer by either a bulk process, a suspension process or a combination of bulk and suspension processes. Some impact polystyrene is also produced by mechanical blending of rubber with polystyrene but such products are not suitable for use in this invention. Examples of rubbers used in the manufacture of impact polystyrene include the styrene-butadiene rubbery polymers, the thermoplastic rubbery block vinylidene aromatic hydrocarbon-conjugated diolefin polymers, polybutadienes and polyisoprenes. Limited use is also made of ethylene-propylene-diene rubber. Numerous other rubbers have been described as usable for this purpose but have not been commercially developed. Preferred rubbers are the polybutadienes, including those prepared with an alkyl lithium catalyst and those prepared with a Ziegler Natta catalyst. The amount of rubber incorporated into the impact polystyrene may be from 1 to about 15% by weight and more usually is from about 4 to 10% by weight. Impact polystyrenes frequently also contain a small amount of a lubricant to improve the moulding characteristics. Such lubricants include mineral oils, paraffin waxes and organic esters such as butyl stearate. The amount of such lubricants incorporated into the impact polystyrenes is usually from about 1 to about 5 weight per cent. In the process of this invention, a masterbatch is formed by blending an impact polystyrene with rubber, filler and oil. The impact polystyrene will contain from 1 to 15 weight per cent of a rubber selected from polybutadiene, polyisoprene, thermoplastic rubber block vinylidene aromatic hydrocarbon-conjugated diolefin polymers and ethylene-propylenediene rubber as hereinbefore described. The impact polystyrene must contain some grafted rubber and does not include mechanical blends of crystal polystyrene with rubber. Suitable rubbers to be blended with the impact polystyrene in the process of forming the masterbatch are polymers of a diolefinic hydrocarbon which include styrene-butadiene rubbers containing up to 45 weight per cent of bound styrene, a blended product containing an average of from 40 to 60 weight per cent of bound styrene and being a blend of (a) styrenebutadiene rubber containing from 15 to 35 weight per cent of bound styrene and (b) styrene-butadiene polymer containing from 75 to 95 weight per cent of bound styrene, polybutadiene rubber, high cis-1,4 polyisoprene, natural rubber, thermoplastic rubber block copolymers comprising vinyl- or vinylidene-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon polymer blocks and conjugated diolefin polymer blocks, ethylene-propylene-diene rubbers or mixtures thereof. Preferred rubbers include the styrene-butadiene rubbers, the polybutadienes and the thermoplastic rubbery block copolymers. The amount of rubber added to the impact polystyrene is from 1 part by weight to about 40 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the impact polystyrene. Preferred amounts of rubber are from 5 parts to 25 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the impact polystyrene. Suitable fillers for forming the masterbatch include the inorganic mineral fillers such as calcium or magnesium carbonates, calcium sulphate, clays, aluminum silicate, silica, talc, mica, vermiculite, asbestos fibres and glass fibres. Suitable fillers also include naturally derived products such as particulate starch, wood sawdust and the various wood flours. Also included as suitable fillers are the small sized, essentially spherical glass beads having an average diameter range of about 10 to about 60 microns. Mixtures of these fillers may also be used, for example mixtures of glass beads and an inorganic mineral filler are suitable. Quantities of filler added to the impact polystyrene are from 10 to 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of impact polystyrene. Preferred amounts of filler are from 25 to 100 parts by weight. Suitable oils that may be added to form the masterbatch include the mixed naphthenic-aromatic oils and, when colour is not a problem, the highly aromatic oils. The amount of oil is from 1 to 40 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of impact polystyrene, and preferably from 5 to 25 parts by weight. The masterbatch of impact polystyrene, rubber, filler and oil is prepared by any suitable method wherein the impact polystyrene can be melted or fluxed and the other components can be well mixed with and dispersed in the molten polystyrene. For example, the high impact polystyrene can be fed to a hot two-roll mill, maintained at a temperature of at least about 110.degree.C to about 160.degree.C, preferably from 120.degree. C to about 150.degree.C, fluxed on the mill rolls and the rubber filler and oil added separately or as a combination of any two or three components. The mixture is maintained on the hot mill rolls until good dispersion is obtained. The masterbatch can be removed as sheet product and used, per se, or can be pelletized. The masterbatch can also be prepared in an internal mixer such as a Banbury mixer, using a temperature of about 110.degree.C to about 160.degree.C, preferably about 120.degree.C to 145.degree.C. The masterbatch can also be prepared in an extruder providing that adequate mixing is achieved with the extruder. In the process of this invention, the masterbatch is mixed with a polystyrene composition to yield the final product. The masterbatch is preferably supplied to this mixing operation in pellet form. The mixing with the polystyrene composition can then be achieved with equipment readily available in the thermoplastics industry. Pellet form masterbatch can be dry mixed with pellet form polystyrene composition in a tumbler and the mixed pellets then fed to the shaping equipment, optionally via a heated extruder. Pellet form masterbatch can be metered into the hopper of a heated extruder and pellet form polystyrene can be separately metered into the same hopper of the extruder, the mixing then being achieved within the barrel of the heated extruder. The extruder may be used solely for the mixing or can be part of a forming machine such as an injection moulding machine, as is well known in the art. Pellet form masterbatch can be metered into a heated extruder which forms a part of the process for the manufacture of polystyrene. For example, a devolatilizing extruder is frequently used to remove the final traces of monomer from polystyrene compositions, whether produced by a bulk polymerization process or a suspension process or a combined bulk/suspension process. The masterbatch can be added to this extruder for mixing with the polystyrene composition. Mixing of the masterbatch with the polystyrene composition can also be achieved on a hot mill or on a Banbury mixer, if such are available. The polystyrene composition to be mixed with the masterbatch is selected from crystal polystyrene and impact polystyrenes. Various grades of crystal polystyrene may be used. An impact polystyrene when used will usually contain a relatively low proportion of rubber such as less than about 10 weight per cent. The exact nature of the polystyrene composition which is mixed with the masterbatch is dependent more on cost and availability of the polystyrene composition. In the mixing of the masterbatch with the polystyrene composition, the proportion of the two components to be mixed depends on the composition of the masterbatch and the desired properties of the final product. Generally, it is preferred that the final product should contain at least about 5 parts by weight of filler per 100 parts by weight of final product. The final product will not contain more than about 50 parts by weight of filler per 100 parts by weight of final product. Preferably, the final product contains from about 10 to about 30 parts by weight of filler per 100 parts by weight of final product. The final product is a filled, mouldable thermoplastic composition of acceptable properties, reasonable cost and which can be readily formed into its end product shape by any of the conventional means. The advantages of this product over the conventional polystyrene composition lie in the reduced cost associated with the product of this process and in the reduction of the amount of styrene used per pound and per unit volume of final product. It is surprising that the final product should have such an acceptable balance of properties, which balance of properties is attributed to the use of a masterbatch of the composition hereinbefore shown to incorporate the filler, in the light of the prior art knowledge of the properties of some thermoplastics containing only filler. The final product is novel by virtue of the type and number of components contained in it and the complete lack of anticipatory literature on the subject. The process of making the final product is novel in the light of the methods whereby the components are incorporated into it. In the following examples, which are illustrative of the invention and not intended to limit the scope thereof, the following materials and test methods were used. The impact polystyrene contained 9 weight % of a high (98%) cis-1,4 polybutadiene incorporated during polymerization of the styrene. The properties of this polystyrene are given as the \"Control\" in Example 1. The wood flour was kiln dried Ponderosa pine, supplied by International Filler Corporation of New York, one sample (No. 60) passing a 60 mesh screen and a second sample (No. 100) passing a 100 mesh screen. The calcium carbonate is a wet ground limestone, having a specific gravity of 2.71 and an average particle size of 2 microns known as CAMEL-WITE (CAMEL-WITE is a registered trademark). The corn starch was a fine grain corn starch having a specific gravity of 1.5 and an average particle size of about 4 microns, manufactured by St. Lawrence Starch Co. The oil is a mixed paraffinic/naphthenic hydrocarbon oil having a specific gravity of 0.844 to 0.864 at 25.degree.C, a viscosity of 100.degree.F of 95-105 SUS, a kinematic viscosity at 100.degree. F of 19.3-21.7 centistokes and a flash point of 365.degree.F known as DRAKEOL 10 (DRAKEOL is a registered trademark). Rubber-1 is a commercial styrene-butadiene rubber containing 23.5 weight % of bound styrene and having a Mooney viscosity (ML 1+4 at 100.degree.C) of 51, further identified as KRYLENE 1500 (KRYLENE is a registered trademark). Rubber-2 is a commercial high cis-1,4 polybutadiene having 98% cis-1,4 content and a Mooney viscosity (ML 1+4 at 100.degree.C) of 42, further identified as TAKTENE 1203 (TAKTENE is a registered trademark). Rubber-3 is a commercially available ethylene-propylene-ethylidene norbornene polymer having a Mooney viscosity (ML 1+8 at 121.degree.C) of 40, identified as EPsyn 40 (EPsyn is a registered trademark). The masterbatch was prepared by mixing in a Model B Banbury internal mixer at a temperature of 270.degree.F, a rotor speed of 77 rpm and for a time of 41/2 minutes. The pellet form polystyrene was added first and fluxed: at 11/2 minutes the rubber, oil and filler were added. The masterbatch was dumped from the Banbury, sheeted out on a two-roll rubber mill, with the rolls at 270.degree.F, the sheets were cooled and then chopped into pellets. The masterbatch cut-back was by adding pellets of polystyrene to a two-roll rubber mill maintained at 270.degree.F and forming a band on the rolls, following which the masterbatch was slowly (over about 5 minutes) added to the fluxed polystyrene. The complete mixing time was about 10 to 15 minutes. The final composition was then sheeted off the mill. The specimens used for testing were injection moulded. The final composition was chopped into pellets and fed to a Mini-jector ram injection machine using a ram pressure of 1100 psi, an injection temperature of 425.degree.F and a mould temperature of 100.degree.F on a one minute cycle.

In accordance with embodiment (a) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by cyclising a compound of formula II. This cyclisation is carried out very readily and can be expedited, if necessary, by standing for a long time and/or by applying of heat. The cyclisation can be carried out in neutral, alkaline or acidic medium. The cyclisation is conveniently carried out in an inert organic solvent; for example, in hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene etc, in chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, methylene chloride etc, in ethers such as dioxan, etc. Suitable temperatures for the cyclisation of compounds of formula II are temperatures in the range between room temperature and about 150.degree. C. depending, of course, on the solvent which is used. In a preferred embodiment there are used conditions which enable the water which is formed in the cyclisation to be azeotropically removed. The compounds of formula II need not necessarily be used in isolated form and in many cases this is even not possible. Generally, it has been found to be convenient to cyclise the compounds of formula II directly or to leave them to cyclise without isolation from the reaction mixture in which they have been prepared. In accordance with embodiment (b) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by removing the protecting group or the protecting groups from a benzodiazepine derivative of formula III. Suitable nitrogen-protecting groups for the purpose of the present invention are primarily acyl groups, preferably readily cleavable alkoxycarbonyl or aralkoxycarbonyl groups, especially the t-butoxycarbonyl group, the benzyloxycarbonyl group etc, as well as readily cleavable aralkyl groups such as the benzyl group. Suitable oxygen-protecting groups are on the one hand acyl groups or aralkyl groups such as those mentioned above as nitrogen-protecting groups and on the other hand acetal and ketal protecting groups such as tetrahydro-2-pyranyl, 2-methoxy-2-propyl, methoxymethyl, .beta.-methoxyethoxy-methyl etc, readily cleavable alkyl groups such as t-butyl etc or alkanoyl groups such as acetyl and the like. The removal of the protecting group or of the protecting groups from the benzodiazepine derivatives of formula III is carried out according to methods known per se, whereby, of course, the nature of the protecting group or protecting groups to be removed must be taken into consideration when choosing the method or methods used for the removal. In addition, it will, of course, be appreciated that only those methods can be used which selectively remove the protecting group or protecting groups without affecting other structural elements present in the molecule. The groups mentioned above as examples of protecting groups can be cleaved off, depending on their nature, hydrogenolytically and/or hydrolytically. Thus, for example, the benzyloxycarbonyl group and the t-butoxycarbonyl group can be cleaved off under selective acidic conditions; for example, by treatment with a mixture of hydrogen bromide and glacial acetic acid or by treatment with boron trifluoride or boron tribromide in an inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane. The t-butoxycarbonyl group can also be cleaved off by treatment with hydrogen chloride in an inert organic solvent such as dioxan, tetrahydrofuran or the like or by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. The tetrahydropyranyl group can be cleaved off under mild acidic conditions; for example, by treatment with dilute aqueous mineral acid or by transacetalisation with a lower alcohol such as, for example, methanol or ethanol in the presence of an acidic catalyst such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, pyridinium p-toluenesulphonate or the like. The t-butyl group can be cleaved off, for example, using trifluoroacetic acid. The benzyl group can be cleaved off by catalytic hydrogenation (e.g. over palladium/carbon). The acetyl group can be cleaved off under mild alkaline conditions; for example, with a solution of a sodium alcoholate in the corresponding alcohol (e.g. methanolic sodium methylate). If Z and Z' in compounds of formula III, wherein R.sup.61 signifies a group of the formula ZZ'N--, signify a single protecting group, then there primarily come into consideration cyclic imides (e.g. phthalimides). Such a protecting group can be readily cleaved off (e.g. with hydrazine). In accordance with embodiment (c) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by reacting a benzodiazepine derivative of formula Ia with a halide of formula IV. This reaction is carried out in the presence of an acid-binding agent; for example, an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate etc or an organic base such as a tertiary amino compound (e.g. triethylamine, N-ethyl-diisopropylamine, quinuclidine and the like). The reaction of the compounds of formulae Ia and IV is conveniently carried out at room temperature or at a temperature below room temperature; it proceeds relatively slowly and generally takes several days. In accordance with embodiment (d) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by reacting a benzodiazepine derivative of formula Ia with an isocyanate of formula V. This reaction is conveniently carried out in an organic solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions; for example, in a halogenated hydrocarbon such as, for example, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, chloroform or o-dichlorobenzene, in an ether such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, dimethoxyethane or diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether, or the like. In many cases it has been found to be favourable to carry out the reaction in the presence of a catalytically-acting small amount of a base; for example, in the presence of a tertiary amino compound such as triethylamine, N-ethyl-diisopropylamine, quinuclidine etc. The temperature at which the reaction is carried out is not critical and the reaction can therefore be carried out at room temperature or at a temperature below room temperature or above room temperature (e.g. at the reflux temperature). In accordance with embodiment (e) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by reacting a benzodiazepine derivative of formula VI with an amino compound of formula VII. In this case, the benzodiazepine derivative of formula VI is conveniently prepared in the manner described below from the corresponding benzodiazepine derivative of formula Ia shortly or immediately before the reaction with the amino compound of formula VII and is introduced into the reaction not in isolated form but in the solution in which it has previously been prepared from the corresponding benzodiazepine derivative of formula Ia. An amino compound of formula VII can then be added to the aforementioned solution containing the benzodiazepine derivative of formula VI. In so doing, the amino compound can be used in the form of a solution or also in the absence of a solvent. Where an amino compound which is gaseous at room temperature is used (e.g. in the case of methylamine), it can be introduced as the gas into the aforementioned solution containing the isocyanate of formula VI. On the other hand, it is also possible to add the aforementioned solution of the isocyanate of formula VI to the amino compound, conveniently in the form of a solution. In many cases it is convenient to use an excess of the amino compound of formula VII and this is indeed necessary when it contains more than one nitrogen atom which is capable of reacting with an isocyanate group (e.g. in the case of piperazine). Various organic solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions (e.g. halogenated hydrocarbons such as, for example, dichloroethane, methylene chloride, chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene and ethers such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, dimethoxyethane and diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether or the like) are suitable as the solvent for embodiment (e) of the process. The reaction of a benzodiazepine derivative of formula VI with an amino compound of formula VII is conveniently carried out at room temperature or at a temperature below room temperature. When the amino compound of formula VII is added to a solution of the isocyanate of formula VI, the addition should be performed within a short time, whereas in the opposite case (i.e. when the solution of the isocyanate of formula II is added to the amino compound of formula VII then the promptness with which the addition is carried out plays no essential role. In accordance with embodiment (f) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by treating a compound of formula VIII with an alkylating agent which yields the group R.sup.1. Any suitable alkylating agent can be used for the present process embodiment. In this case, there are conveniently used halides such as, for example, methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, isopropyl bromide, n-propyl bromide, n-butyl bromide, 2-bromoethanol, N,N-diethylamino-ethyl chloride and the like, dialkyl sulphates such as, for example, dimethyl sulphate and diethyl sulphate, or the like, and the reaction is carried out in an inert organic solvent; for example, in an ether such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan and diethyl ether or in acetone, N,N-dimethylformamide or the like in the presence of an acid-binding agent such as, for example, potassium and sodium carbonate, conveniently at room temperature. In accordance with embodiment (g) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by halogenating a compound of formula Ib. Convenient halogenating agents, which can be used are compounds such as N-chloro-succinimide, N-bromo-succinimide, N-chloro-acetamide and the like. Suitable solvents for the present process aspect are primarily halogenated hydrocarbons such as, for example, methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform and the like or other inert organic solvents such as, for example, acetonitrile, ether etc. However, aqueous systems such as, for example, mixtures of concentrated hydrochloric acid and formic acid and the like can also be used. The halogenation is preferably carried out at a temperature of about 0.degree. C. to room temperature, conveniently at room temperature. Other suitable halogenating agents are elemental halogens such as chlorine gas and bromine. In this case, the halogenation is preferably carried out in acidic aqueous solution, whereby in many cases the corresponding hydrogen halide is conveniently used as the acid, at temperatures of about -10.degree. to +10.degree. C., preferably at 0.degree. C., or in an acidic organic solvent such as, for example, formic acid, acetic acid and the like, conveniently at room temperature, or at a temperature below room temperature or above room temperature. In accordance with embodiment (h) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by converting the primary amino group in a compound of formula Ia into the nitro group. For example, a diazonium salt such as the corresponding diazonium tetrafluoroborate, which is readily accessible from the amine of formula Ia and need not be isolated, can be reacted with a nitrite such as sodium nitrite, and a copper (I) salt. This reaction is conveniently carried out in water at a temperature of about -10.degree. C. to room temperature. An amino compound of formula Ia can, however, also be converted into the corresponding nitro compound by oxidation. Hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid and a catalytic amount of a mineral acid such as sulphuric acid is conveniently used as the oxidising agent. Other suitable oxidising agents are, for example, peracetic acid, perbenzoic acid, trifluoroperacetic acid and the like. The reaction conditions which are necessary can be readily ascertained by any person skilled in the art. In accordance with embodiment (i) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by reducing the nitro group in a compound of formula Ia to the amino group. The reduction is conveniently carried out using a reducing agent such as tin (II) chloride, tin, zinc and the like in acidic aqueous medium (e.g. in aqueous hydrochloric acid, concentrated hydrochloric acid or the like) at a temperature in the range of about 0.degree. C. to room temperature. In accordance with embodiment (j) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by monoalkylating or dialkylating the primary amino group in a compound of formula Ia. The alkylating agent can be a halide such as methyl iodide, isopropyl bromide or n-butyl bromide or a dialkyl sulphate such as dimethyl sulphate or diethyl sulphate in combination with an acid-binding agent such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, triethylamine, quinuclidine and the like or an aldehyde or ketone such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde or acetone in combination with a reducing agent such as formic acid. The alkylation is conveniently carried out in an organic solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions such as acetonitrile, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane and the like. If the reaction is carried out using an aldehyde or ketone in the presence of a reducing agent, then formic acid is conveniently used as the solvent and reducing agent. The temperature at which the present process aspect is carried out is not critical. Therefore, this alkylation can be carried out at room temperature or at a temperature below room temperature or above room temperature (e.g. at the boiling point of the reaction mixture). In accordance with embodiment (k) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of general formula I can be manufactured by alkylating the secondary amino group in a compound of formula Id. This reaction can be carried out in analogy to the monoalkylation or dialkylation of compounds of formula Ia in accordance with embodiment (j) of the process. In accordance with embodiment (1) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by reacting a compound of formula Ia with a dihalide of formula IX. This reaction is conveniently carried out in an inert organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide and the like in the presence of an acid-binding agent such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, triethylamine, pyridine, quinuclidine and the like. Preferably, the reaction is carried out at room temperature, although it can, however, also be carried out at a temperature below room temperature (e.g. at 0.degree.C.) or above room temperature. In accordance with embodiment (m) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by treating a compound of formula Ie with phosgene. Especially suitable solvents for the present process embodiment are halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane and the like. Other suitable solvents are ethers such as t-butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and the like, acetonitrile, benzene, dimethylformamide etc. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of about 0.degree. C. to room temperature. In accordance with embodiment (n) of the process, a 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivative of formula I can be manufactured by hydrolytically opening the aziridine ring in a compound of formula If. This hydrolytic ring-opening is carried out under acidic conditions, where coming into consideration only those acids whose anion does not react with the aziridine ring. The hydrolytic ring-opening is conveniently carried out in the presence of a suitable organic solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions and at room temperature. For example, the reaction can be carried out by dissolving the compound of formula If in dioxan or the like, adding to the solution a small amount of a mineral acid (e.g. a few drops of 25% sulphuric acid) and leaving the mixture to stand for a further short time (e.g. 15 to 30 minutes). In accordance with embodiment (o) of the process, the 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivatives of formula I can be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. The manufacture of such pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts is carried out according to generally customary methods. There come into consideration not only salts with inorganic acids but also salts with organic acids; for example, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulphates, citrates, acetates, succinates, methanesulphonates, p-toluenesulphonates and the like. The compounds of formula II used as starting materials can be prepared according to methods known per se. Conveniently, compounds of formula II are prepared from compounds of the formula ##STR16## wherein R.sup.1,R.sup.2,R.sup.3,R.sup.4,R.sup.5,R.sup.6,R.sup.7 and R.sup.8 are as above and Y is a protecting group, Compounds of formula X can also be prepared according to methods known per se.

After protecting the primary amino group present in a compound of formula XIII with a suitable reagent which yields the group Y such as chloroformic acid benzyl ester or the like and alkylating the resulting compound with an alkylating agent which yields the group R.sup.1 in analogy to embodiment (f) of the process, there is obtained a compound of the formula ##STR20## wherein R.sup.1,R.sup.2,R.sup.3,R.sup.4,R.sup.8 and Y are as above.

For example, a compound of formula Xb can be reacted with a carbamoyl halide of the formula A further possibility for the preparation of compounds of formula II comprises converting a nitrobenzophenone derivative of formula XI into a compound of the formula ##STR25## wherein R.sup.4, R.sup.8 and Y are as above and Y' is hydrogen or a protecting group, whereby Y and Y' together can be a single protecting group, By cleaving off the protecting group denoted by Y and, previously or in the same operation, also the protecting group(s) present in the group R.sup.66 there are now obtained, from compounds of formula XXIV, compounds of formula II. The compounds of formula III used as starting materials can be prepared for example, by selectively cleaving off the protecting group denoted by Y from compounds of formula XIV and from compounds of formula XXIV wherein R.sup.66 is protected lower alkylamino or a group of the formula ZZ'N-- and cyclising the resulting compound in analogy to embodiment (a) of the process.

The compounds of formula VI used as starting materials can be prepared, as already mentioned above, from corresponding compounds of formula Ia by reaction with phosgene. In this case, conveniently a solution of phosgene in an organic solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions is prepared and then, while cooling, there is added thereto a solution of a compound of formula Ia, the mixture is thereupon heated to boiling under reflux for a short time, then cooled down and finally the solution obtained is made basic or at least neutral with a tertiary organic amino compound such as triethylamine. The resulting solution, containing a compound of formula VI, can be stored for several hours with the exclusion of moisture and in the cold; it is, as indicated above, used directly in the process of the invention without isolating the compound of formula VI contained therein. The compounds of formula VIII used as starting materials are known or can be prepared according to methods known per se; for example, by cyclising a compound of formula XIII in analogy to embodiment (a) of the process and, if desired, reducing the nitro group in the resulting compound in analogy to embodiment (i) of the process to the amino group and dialkylating the latter in analogy to embodiment (j) of the process. Compounds of formula VIII can, however, also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula XXIII wherein R.sup.66 is lower dialkylamino as described earlier with a compound of formula XIII and cyclising the product obtained. A further possibility for the preparation of compounds of formula VIII comprises removing, from a compound of formula XXV, the protecting group(s) present in the group R.sup.67 and alkylating the resulting amino compound in analogy to embodiment (j) or (k) of the process. The compounds of formulae, II, III and VI used as starting materials are novel and are likewise objects of the present invention. Surprisingly, it has been shown that the 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivatives of formula I hereinbefore display no or only very slight activities on the central nervous system, whereas they exhibit pronounced aldosterone-antagonistic properties. These aldosterone-antagonistic properties can be demonstrated in adrenalectomised rats as illustrated hereinafter. If aldosterone is administered to adrenalectomised rats then there is observed, in comparison with untreated animals, a pronounced reduction of the sodium excretion (sodium retention), an increased potassium excretion (potassium excretion) as well as a reduction of the excreted urine volume. If compounds of formula I are administered to the animals before the treatment with aldosterone, then there is observed, in comparison with the animals which are treated only with aldosterone (control animals), a pronounced increase of the sodium excretion (i.e. the sodium retention caused by aldosterone is antagonised), whereas the potassium excretion and urine volume are influenced to a lesser extent. The standard experiment is carried out as follows: Female Holtzmann rats (150-180 g) are bilaterally adrenalectomised 70 to 74 hours before the beginning of the experiment. After the operation, the animals receive a customary rat dry feed and 0.9% sodium chloride solution for drinking. 16-17 hours before the beginning of the experiment the feed is removed from the animals, but they can subsequently drink, as before, 0.9% sodium chloride solution ad libitum. At the beginning of the experiment the substance to be tested as an aldosterone-antagonist is administered to the animals by means of a stomach probe. 30 minutes later the animals receive a subcutaneous injection of 4 mmg/kg of aldosterone. After a further 90 minutes, the urinary bladders of the animals are emptied by careful surprapubic pressure, whereupon the animals are placed individually in metabolic cages without food and without drink. The urine of the animals is then collected for 3 hours, whereupon their urinary bladders are once more emptied. The spontaneously excreted urine and the remaining urine obtained at the conclusion of the experiment by pressing-out the urinary bladders are collected in graduated centrifuge glasses. Sodium and potassium concentrations in the urine are determined with a flame photometer. The following Table contains results obtained in the previously described experiment with representative compounds of formula I. In this Table there are given for each compound referred to therein the dosage administered (in mg/kg p.o.) as well as the percentage variation in the urine volume, the sodium excretion and the potassium excretion in comparison with the control animals (i.e. in comparison with the animals treated only with aldosterone). Moreover, the Table contains data relating to the acute toxicity of the compounds investigated (LD 50 in mg/kg in the case of single oral administration to mice). The benzodiazepine derivatives of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, for example, in the form of pharmaceutical preparations., The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, for example in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be carried out rectally (e.g. in the form of suppositories) or parenterally (e.g. in the form of injection solutions). For the manufacture of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules, the benzodiazepine derivatives of general formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutical inert, inorganic and/or organic carriers. Examples of carriers which can be used for tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules are lactose, maize starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc. Suitable carriers for soft gelatin capsules are vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols etc. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, generally necessary in the case of soft gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugars, glucose and the like. Suitable carriers for injection solutions are water, alcohols, polyols, glycerine, vegetable oils and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like. The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain other therapeutically valuable substances and/or adjuvants such as preserving agents, solubilising agents, stabilisers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweetening agents, colouring agents, flavouring agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants. Medicaments containing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof are likewise an object of the present invention as is a process for the manufacture of such medicaments, which is characterised by bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof into galenical administration form. A further object of the present invention is the use of 3,3-dialkylbenzodiazepine derivatives of formula I and of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof in the control or prevention of illnesses, especially in the control or prevention of heart failure, of hepatic ascites, of primary aldosteronism and of idiophatic hypertension. The dosage can vary within wide limits and is, of course, fitted to the individual requirements in any particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 20 mg to 1500 mg should be appropriate.
