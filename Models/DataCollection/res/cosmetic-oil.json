In particular, the invention is concerned with polymer dispersions obtained by emulsion polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated or polyunsaturated monomers. Preferred polymer dispersions (latex polymers) for which the method of the invention can best be used are the water immiscible emulsion homopolymers and copolymers of C.sub.4.sub.-6 conjugated diolefins such as butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene, 2,3-dimethyl-butadiene and 2-methyl-butadiene. Suitable comonomers include ethylenically unsaturated compounds such as vinyl aromatic compounds (styrene, 2-methylstyrene, vinyl toluene, divinyl benzene, and chlorinated styrenes), vinylidene chloride, vinyl pyrrolidone, acrylic nitriles (acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile), lower alkyl esters of acrylic acids (ethyl acrylate, methylmethacrylate and butylacrylate), carboxylic acid amides and copolymerizable .alpha.-.beta.-unsaturated carboxylic acids, (acrylic, methacrylic, itaconic, maleic and fumaric acids) and the lower alkyl monoesters of polymerizable dicarboxylic acids (monomethyl itaconate). In the preparation of polymer dispersions by emulsion polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated or polyunsaturated monomers, it is often advantageous to make the dispersions with particles of small diameter, typically in the range of 0.05 to 0.25 .mu.. in order to benefit from the high rates of conversion of monomer to polymer obtainable when the particle size is small. However, in many technological applications, fine particled polymer dispersions suffer from certain drawbacks, such as a low tolerance towards fillers, pigments, vulcanizing ingredients and the like, as well as from instability towards agitation, shearing forces and other mechanical influences. Further drawbacks may be found in the rheological properties of fine particled dispersions, notably high viscosity at low shear rates or at high concentration. In order to overcome the disadvantages of fineparticled dispersions, various processes have been proposed for agglomerating the particles. Some of these processes are purely physical, involving the expenditure of energy, some are chemical and some are a combination of physical and chemical processes. Many of these processes can not be applied to latex polymers derived from mixtures of monomers of which at least one provides hydrophilic groups in the polymer, e.g. carboxylated latices, or can not be applied to such latex polymers in such a way as to provide reproducible results. Among chemical agglomerating agents, it has been proposed to employ polyethoxylated compounds of the formula ##EQU1## where R is an organic hydrophobic group A is a hydrogen atom or an R(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.m H group B is a hydrogen atom or an (CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.p H group n, m and p are each 23 to 455 and the weight ratio of R to ethylene oxide chains is from 1:3 to 2:1. The preferred chemical agglomerating agents of the above formula are obtained by reacting polyoxyethylene glycol with the reaction product of a polyhydric phenol and epichlorohydrin. It has also been indicated that in order to agglomerate a synthetic rubber containing carboxy groups, it is necessary that the latex should have a content of free emulsifier of from 0.1 to 3.5% with reference to latex solids, and that from 10 to 55% of the carboxylic groups contained in the synthetic rubber should be neutralized. The amount of emulsifier may be increased to 4.0% and up to 70% of the carboxyl groups may be neutralized if the pH during polymerization is maintained in the range from 1.5 to 3.6. It is believed that these critical conditions are necessary with certain disclosed agglomerating agents and that such carboxylated latices can not be agglomerated or reproducibly agglomerated with certain other previously proposed chemical agglomerating agents or physical agglomerating processes. We have now discovered a class of polyethoxylated compounds which are useful for agglomerating both carboxylated and non-carboxylated polymers over a wide range of conditions and which do not require critical conditions as to free emulsifier content and neutralization of carboxyl groups, if present. The surfactants having this effect belong to the class of non-ionic polyethoxylated high and/or substituted long chain fatty acid esters and higher hydrocarbyl amines. In particular the polyethoxylated fatty acid esters are those of aliphatic (including cycloaliphatic) polyols. Examples of suitable esterifying polyols are glycerol, sorbitol, pentaerithritol, alkylene glycols, di-alkylene glycols, trimethylol propane, mannitol, glucose and sucrose. The preferred fatty acid esters are the readily and economically available glycerides contained in or derived from naturally occurring oils and fats. Typical compounds useful for carrying out the present invention include the following: 1. Polyethoxylated completely esterified polyols, such as glycerol, alkylene glycols, pentaerithritol, sorbitol, mannitol and trimethylol propane, in which at least one of the esterifying long chain fatty acids contains a substituent group on its hydrophobic long chain capable of reacting with ethylene oxide to append a poly(ethylene oxide) chain, e.g. amino or hydroxy groups. Ricinoleic and 12-hydroxy stearic acids are examples of such substituted fatty acids and suitable surfactant compounds of this type are represented by polyethoxylated castor oil or polyethoxylated hydrogenated castor oil; 2. Polyethoxylated partial fatty acid esters of polyols, such as glycerol, sorbitol, ethylene glycol, di-ethylene glycol and trimethylol propane, in which one or more of the esterifying long chain fatty acids may contain ethoxylatable substituent groups as described immediately above; and 3. Polyethoxylated long chain alkyl amines (including aralkyl amines), optionally containing one or more ethoxylatable substituent groups on the alkyl chain. In the case of both the fatty acid components of the esters and the alkyl amines described above it is preferred that the hydrophobic portions thereof be from about 12 to about 22 carbon atoms in length and preferably from about 14 to 20 carbon atoms. The polyethoxylated surfactants of this invention are further characterized by having: 1. An HLB number in the range of from 16 to 19.5. A definition of the term \"HLB number\" is given in articles by W. C. Griffin in Journal Soc. Cosmetic Chemists, Volume 1, p.311 (1949) and Volume 5, p.249 (1957). For the purpose of this invention, the HLB number may be calculated from the expression ##EQU2## where H is the molecular weight of the hydrophilic portion of the polyethoxylated surfactant and M is the total molecular weight of the surfactant. In the case of polyethoxylated fatty acid esters of polyols, H may be represented with sufficient accuracy by the molecular weight of the polyoxyethylene chains plus the molecular weight of the polyol. In the case of the polyethoxylated amines, H may be represented by the molecular weight of the polyoxyethylene chains only; and 2. A molecular weight in the range of from 1800 to 25,000 and preferably in the range of from 2500 to 20,000. The polymer dispersions capable of being coarsened or agglomerated by the present process are those stabilized predominantly by surfactants and/or by the presence in the polymer of hydrophilic comonomers, examples of which are .alpha.,.beta.-ethylenically unsaturated mono- di- or polycarboxylic acids, di- or poly-carboxylic acid partial alkyl esters, carboxylic acid amides, carboxylic acid monoesters of diols or polyols, carboxylic esters of amino-alcohols and vinyl pyrrolidone. Surfactant dispersion stabilizers are well known to those skilled in the art of emulsion polymerization. Typical examples are the higher alkyl esters of sulphosuccinic acid, the C.sub.8 to C.sub.20 hydrocarbyl sulphates or sulphonates and the polyethoxylated alkanols, alkylated phenols, alkanoic acids or acid amides and their sulphated, sulphonated or phosphated derivatives. It is a further prerequisite of the present process that the surfaces of the dispersed polymer particles are incompletely covered by any stabilizing surfactants. This may be determined by soap titration according to Nouben-Weyl \"Methoden der organischen Chemie\" Vol. 14/1, p.370, and will usually be found to be the case if the surface tension of the polymer dispersion is higher than 50 dynes/cm. and preferably higher than 55 dynes/cm. For irreversible coalescence of fine particles to coarser ones to take place, it is furthermore necessary that the polymer constituting the major volume proportion of the dispersed polymer particles, e.g. in a dispersion of mixed polymers, should have a glass transition temperature (Tg) below and preferably more than 20.degree.C. below the temperature at which the coalescence is induced. Fortunately, many polymers, e.g. those containing a high proportion of butadiene and/or isoprene and/or acrylic acid esters of higher alkanols have a glass transition temperature well below 0.degree.C. Thus, irreversible coalescence can frequently be readily achieved at ambient temperature when employing the present process. Based on the foregoing, the present invention broadly provides a process for enlarging the particle size of a polymer dispersion, wherein the polymer dispersion is mixed with a surfactant which is a non-ionic polyethoxylated high and/or substituted fatty acid ester or higher hydrocarbyl amine. In particular, the surfactant should have an HLB number (as hereinbefore defined) of from 16 to 19.5 and a molecular weight of from 1800 to 25,000, while the polymer should be stabilized either by groups derived from hydrophilic monomers or by a stabilizing surfactant present in an amount which is not sufficient completely to cover the surfaces of the dispersed particles. Finally, the enlarging process should take place at a temperature above the glass transition temperature of the polymer constituent constituting the major volume proportion of the dispersed polymer. In order to carry the present process into effect, the polyethoxylated surfactant is preferably first dissolved in a suitable solvent for the surfactant, ordinarily in water or a water-containing mixture, and is then mixed with the polymer dispersion to be treated. The surfactant solution may be added to the polymer dispersion or vice versa. The quantity of surfactant employed may vary from 0.01 to 5 parts dry per 100 parts of polymer contained in the dispersion. Preferably the quantity is in the range of 0.02 to 1.0 part of surfactant per 100 parts of polymer. The polyethoxylated surfactants used in the present process, especially those having molecular weights in excess of 3000 and HLB numbers higher than 17 may, when added to the fine particled polymer dispersion, frequently cause the formation of macroscopic coagulum. Several methods are envisaged to minimize or obviate the danger of such coagulum formation and these are as follows: 1. The addition of a stabilizing surfactant of the type normally employed in the process of emulsion polymerization and mentioned previously in that context to either the dispersion or the solution of the coarsening surfactant before or during the mixing of the two. Suitable stabilizing surfactants include non-ionic surfactants, e.g. polyethoxylated C.sub.12 -C.sub.20 alcohols, alkylated phenols, amides and aminos with HLB numbers lower than 17 and preferably lower than 16 and with molecular weights lower than 1500 and preferably lower than 1200. Examples of other suitable stabilizing surfactants are the sulphates, sulphonates, phosphates and sulphosuccinates previously mentioned. 2. Adjustment of the pH value of the polymer dispersion and/or coarsening agent solution to a higher or lower value by the addition of bases or acids which have preferably been diluted with water. In one preferred embodiment of the present process, applicable to dispersions of carboxylated polymers, the pH of the dispersion is first raised to a value greater than will ensure the ionization of at least 50% of the carboxyl groups, by means of a base, which is preferably a volatile base, such as ammonia or an organic amine. The coarsening agent is then added, but does not cause any major alteration of the average particle size until the pH is lowered by the volatilization of the base or by chemical means. Examples of chemical means of lowering the pH of the mixture are the reaction of ammonia with formaldehyde or the addition of an acidic reagent like carbon dioxide, an organic or mineral acid, an acid salt or a substance capable of forming an acid such as an ester, acid amide, anhydride or halide. 3. In a further preferred embodiment of the present process, by the stepwise coarsening of the polymer dispersion. The stepwise coarsening may be achieved in several different ways. For example: a. By the sequential addition to the polymer dispersion of coarsening polyethoxylated surfactants as hereinbefore defined of increasing HLB numbers and molecular weight in two or more steps. In each step, single surfactants or blends of surfactants of the appropriate HLB numbers and molecular weights may be employed. b. By the addition to the polymer dispersion of a mixture of one or more coarsening surfactants with one or more stabilizing surfactants followed in one or more steps by the addition of coarsening surfactant containing lower amounts of stabilizing surfactant or none at all. The last step is preferably carried out with no admixture of a stabilizing surfactant using a coarsening surfactant having an HLB value greater than 17.5 and a molecular weight in excess of 4000. c. By the addition of the polymer dispersion to a solution of one or more coarsening surfactants optionally containing also one or more stabilizing surfactants and/or a pH adjusting base or acid. In the second or any subsequent step, a solution of coarsening surfactant is added to the pre-coarsened dispersion of the first step, preferably in the manner described under 3a. It will be readily understood that suitable combinations of methods 1, 2 and 3a to 3c may be also employed. When carrying out the present process it is furthermore envisaged that the polymer dispersions to be coarsened may be mixtures of two or more separate polymer dispersions. As previously mentioned, in this case only the polymer or polymers constituting the major proportion contained in the mixture need possess a glass transition temperature below the temperature at which the process is performed. It is also envisaged that one or more component dispersions present in a mixed polymer dispersion may have a larger average particle size than the fine particled dispersion to be coarsened. In fact it has been found that the presence of usually minor proportions of coarser particled dispersions may exert a beneficial regulating effect on the particle size distribution of the final coarsened material. This effect may be described as \"seeding\" or \"nucleating\" in as far as the coarser particles present act as seeds or nuclei for at least a proportion of the newly formed coarsened particles. The particle size distribution in the final product is influenced by both the amount and the particle size distribution of the seed dispersion employed. The regulation of particle size distribution in the final product may also be achieved by mixing a suitable \"seed\" dispersion with the solution of polyethoxylated surfactant, whether added by the stepwise method described above or not. The seed dispersion need not have a high surface tension nor a low glass transition temperature. The present process may also be carried out by treating a fine particled polymer dispersion with the aforementioned coarsening agent in the presence of one or more of inert inorganic or organic fillers, pigments, vulcanizing agents, plasticizers, electrolytes, pH buffers, antifoaming agents, chelating agents and other ingredients customarily employed by those skilled in the art of compounding polymer dispersions. The coarsened dispersions obtained by the present process may at any later stage be mixed with such further ingredients as their technological application will require. Examples of such ingredients are dispersants, surfactant stabilizers, acids, bases, plasticizers, vulcanizing ingredients and so on as is customary in the art of using such dispersions. The coarsened dispersions, with or without the addition of further, e.g. stabilizing, ingredients, may be concentrated by evaporation, creaming, centrifuging or similar means well known to those skilled in the art.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method for the production of highly refined oils called white oils from petroleum products, and more particularly to a novel two step process to produce white oils of pharmaceutical grade which will pass the Hot Acid Carbonizable Substances Test and Ultraviolet Absorbance Test. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART White mineral oils called white oils are colorless, transparent, oily liquids obtained by the refining of crude petroleum feedstocks. In the production of white oils the petroleum feedstocks are refined to eliminate as completely as possible oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur compounds, reactive hydrocarbons including aromatics, and any other impurity which would prevent use of the resulting white oil in the pharmaceutical industry. White oils generally fall into two classes, that is, technical grade white oils which are used in cosmetics, textile lubrication, bases for insecticides and the like, and more highly refined pharmaceutical grade white oils such as used in drug compositions, foods and for the lubrication of food handling machinery. For such applications, the pharmaceutical grade white oils must be chemically inert and without color, odor or taste. The present invention is primarily concerned with the production of pharmaceutical grade white oils. The prior art is well aware of numerous processes for the production of white oils of both grades. In general, the first step in the production of white oil has been the removal of the lighter portions, such as gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, and light fractions, from the feedstock by fractional distillation. In the early processes the white oil was then refined by treatment with sulfuric acid to remove unsaturated aromatic and unstable hydroaromatic compounds which comprised most of the impurities present in the oil. Usually, the acid treated oil was then subject to adsorption refining to remove such impurities as carbon, coke, asphaltic substances, coloring matter and the like. The conventional methods of making white oils with sulfuric acid however, have been subject to objection in recent years since acid treating is costly and gives rise to unmanageable amounts of sludge comprising sulfuric acid aromatic adducts and thus environmental objections arise because of the attendant disposal and corrosion problems. Because of objections to sulfuric acid treatments, new procedures have been developed for the production of white oils from hydrocarbond feedstocks. Representative processes are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,629,096, 3,553,107, 3,673,078, U.S. Pat. No. R. 27,845, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,080,313 and 3,392,112. In general, all of these patents disclose production of white oils in generally highly refined states by subjecting the feedstocks to contact with various types of catalysts in one or more steps. In general, in the first step of these processes the feedstock is subjected to a hydrogenation treatment in the presence of a sulfur resistant catalyst to produce an intermediate product of reasonably low sulfur content. The intermediate product is then subjected to a second stage treatment in the presence of hydrogen and a sulfur sensitive catalyst in order to reduce aromatic compounds and produce a substantially pure product. In many of the prior art patents a third stage is then utilized by contacting the second stage product with sulfuric acid and/or adsorption in order to complete the purification and provide a white oil of sufficient purity to meet the pharmaceutical standards for food grade white oils. Of particular pertinence to the present invention is U.S. Pat. No. 3,392,112 to Bercik et al which discloses a method for manufacturing refined oils by a two stage process involving an initial stage of contacting a petroleum hydrocarbon feedback with a sulfur resistant hydrogenation catalyst under hydrogenation conditions to produce a partly hydrogenated intermediate product. Thereafter, the intermediate product is then contacted in a second hydrogenation stage with a sulfur-resistant catalyst comprising reduced nickel composited with a diatomaceous earth. According to the patent, this two stage system will provide a product having a very low sulfur content and having sufficient purity to pass the tests required by the pharmaceutical industry. The process of the present invention is an improvement on this prior process in that the catalyst used in the second stage of the process can be supported not only on Keiselguhr but also on alumina and thus the process is not subject to the specific requirements for using a diatomaceous earth catalyst support. Moreover, the process of the present invention can also be used on feedstocks having a wide range of viscosities to produce very highly refined white oils. Thus, the present invention provides a process of wide application in the art to provide a pharmaceutical grade white oil in a two stage treatment. It is accordingly one object of this invention to provide a process for the production of pharmaceutical grade white oils. It is a further object to this invention to provide a two stage catalytic treatment of petroleum hydrocarbon feedstocks to produce highly pure pharmaceutical grade white oils. A still further object of the invention is to provide a two stage treatment of hydrocarbon feedstocks to produce refind white oils having sufficient purity to pass the Hot Acid Carbonizable Substances Test and Ultraviolet Absorbance Test without the necessity for further purification steps. A still further object of the invention is to provide a two step catalytic treatment of hydrocarbon feedstocks for the production of highly pure white oils for use in pharmaceutical applications utilizing a nickel catalyst in the second stage and without the necessity of additional treatment steps wherein the hydrocarbon feedstock used may have a wide range of viscosities. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as the description thereof proceeds. In satisfaction of the foregoing objects and advantages there is provided by this invention a method for the manufacture of highly refined pharmaceutical grade white oils by a two stage catalytic treatment which comprises subjecting a petroleum feedstock to a first stage hydrogenation in the presence of a sulfur resistant catalyst to effect desulfurization, and then contacting the product recovered from the first stage to a second stage hydrogenation treatment in the presence of a nickel catalyst on a support. The white oil product covered from the second stage is sufficiently pure to pass the Hot Acid Carbonizable Substances Test and Ultraviolet Absorbance Test without the necessity of additional treatment. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Production of White Oils of sufficient purity to pass the Hot Acid Carbonizable Substances Test and Ultraviolet Absorbance Test is carried out in two stages utilizing lubricating oil feedstock of a broad range of viscosities. The first stage hydrogenation utilizes a sulfur-resistant catalyst which produces an intermediate product of lower viscosity than the starting feedstock. The second stage hydrogenation catalyst is nickel on alumina and is further characterized as having a BET surface area in the range of 130-190 m.sup.2 /g.
